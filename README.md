# get_spotify_playlists

Helping people get off Spotify without losing their playlists. 

`secret.yaml` should contain your client_id and client_secret (keep this safe!)

Also I wrote this before somewhere in Winter 2022, but I lost the files and definitely did not version it back then. It 
even searched Pandora and created playlists using the Pandora API. Argh.
